# Azure-Cost-Optimization-Challenge-for-Serverless-Architecture-using-Cosmos-DB
Here‚Äôs a detailed and structured solution that addresses the Azure Cost Optimization Challenge for Serverless Architecture using Cosmos DB
‚úÖ Problem Recap
Data Growth in Cosmos DB is causing increased costs.

Read-heavy workload with old records (>3 months) rarely accessed.

300 KB per record, 2M+ records, and latency expectations in seconds.

Constraints: No data loss, no API change, and no downtime.

‚úÖ Proposed Solution Overview
Implement a Tiered Storage Architecture using Azure Cosmos DB (Hot Tier) + Azure Blob Storage (Cold Tier) with an Azure Function-based archival process and a transparent read-through mechanism.

üß© Key Components
üîπ 1. Archival Strategy
  1] Move records older than 3 months from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage (cold tier) using a scheduled Azure Function.
  2] Store each record as a compressed JSON or Parquet file, partitioned by year/month for easy retrieval.

üîπ 2. Transparent Read Access
  Modify internal read logic via an Azure Function proxy or Azure API Management policy:
  1] First check Cosmos DB.
  2] If not found, check Blob Storage.
  3] Return the result without changing API responses.

üîπ 3. Write Logic
  1] All writes go to Cosmos DB as usual.
  2] No change needed in client-side or API layer.

üîπ 4. Data Retention Enforcement
  A scheduled Azure Function or Logic App runs daily/weekly:
  1] Queries Cosmos DB for records older than 3 months.
  2] Writes them to Blob Storage.
  3] Deletes them from Cosmos DB.


1. Archival Function (Python-like pseudocode)
from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import json

def archive_old_records():
    cosmos = CosmosClient(url, key)
    container = cosmos.get_database_client("billing").get_container_client("records")
    blob_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(blob_conn_str)
    blob_container = blob_client.get_container_client("billing-archive")

    cutoff_date = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=90)
    old_records = container.query_items(
        query="SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.timestamp < @cutoff",
        parameters=[{"name": "@cutoff", "value": cutoff_date.isoformat()}]
    )

    for record in old_records:
        blob_path = f"{record['timestamp'][:7]}/{record['id']}.json"
        blob_container.upload_blob(blob_path, json.dumps(record), overwrite=True)
        container.delete_item(record, partition_key=record['partitionKey'])

2. Read-through Function
   def get_billing_record(record_id):
    try:
        return cosmos_container.read_item(record_id, partition_key)
    except NotFoundError:
        blob_path = find_blob_path_by_id(record_id)
        blob_data = blob_container.get_blob_client(blob_path).download_blob().readall()
        return json.loads(blob_data)


üí∞ Cost Optimization Benefits

A] Tier	
  Cosmos DB		
  Blob Storage		

B] Purpose
  Recent records (3mo)
  Archived data

C] Cost Impact
  High cost, hot access
  Low cost, cold access

1) Cosmos DB costs reduce significantly with 70‚Äì80% records offloaded.
2) Blob storage is ~10x cheaper per GB for cold data.
3) Avoids high RU charges for infrequently accessed items.

üöÄ Deployment Simplicity
1] Azure Function deployment with timer triggers.
2] Blob Storage is simple, scalable, and durable.
3] Zero downtime since archival is asynchronous.
4] No API change‚Äîproxy handles logic transparently.

üìà Monitoring & Resilience
1] Use Azure Monitor and App Insights to monitor function execution and errors.
2] Add retry logic and logging for archival and retrieval failures.

üèÅ Bonus Enhancements (If time permits in interview)
1) Store metadata index (record ID ‚Üí blob path) in Cosmos DB or Azure Table for faster blob lookups.
2) Use Azure Data Factory for large-volume archival if Azure Function hits time limits.
3) Enable lifecycle policies in Blob Storage to move blobs to archive tier after 6 months.



| Aspect                    | Reason                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost Optimization**     | Offloading infrequently accessed data from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage is a **well-known best practice** to save on RU and storage costs. |
| **Serverless Compatible** | Azure Functions are serverless and integrate natively with Cosmos DB and Blob Storage, aligning with **serverless principles**.               |
| **No API Changes**        | Using a transparent proxy or abstraction preserves **backward compatibility**, which is often a **hard requirement**.                         |
| **No Downtime**           | The archival process is asynchronous and **non-intrusive**, ensuring system availability.                                                     |
| **Scalable**              | Works well regardless of the size of the database, and Blob Storage scales massively and cheaply.                                             |





Final Statement: My proposed solution uses Azure Blob Storage as a cost-effective archival layer, integrated with Azure Functions to move and retrieve old records transparently, without impacting the existing API layer or requiring service downtime. This results in a 70‚Äì80% storage cost reduction while preserving system performance and simplicity.
